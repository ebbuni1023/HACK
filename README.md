Team:
* Annie He
* Jiyoung Yoon
* Kelvin Aneesh
* Nate Ventura

We built a mobile app, currently in android, that allows the user who is blind to detect and identify the object using AI. We use Android Studio to build, Git, and Github to collaborate in real time. We also use Teachable Machine platform by Google to teach models.
